# Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analisys
Web application that aims to demonstrate graphically, the analysis of automobile sales data.
This application was developed in python, using libraries such as pandas, altair and streamlit. 
The central objective is to be an object of study about sales data analysis. An exploratory data analysis was performed, 
which allowed filtering the data according to the place and date of sales, as well as generating graphs regarding the progress 
of sales over the years. The pandas library was used to manipulate the data, which came from a database available at 
https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data?select=sales_data_sample.csv. Altair is a library used to generate the graphs 
built during the analyses. And streamlit is a library that allowed the creation of the web application itself.Through it, it is possible 
to insert all the components used, such as text, dataframes, sidebars, buttons, static and interactive graphics, among other widgets.
